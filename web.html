<h1>About</h1><img width="400" height="200" src="images\img2.avif"/>
<p>The 2020 Chevrolet Corvette convertible was recently spied with a hardtop. The vehicle might get a separate rear window which can be raised or lowered for wind deflection when the roof is lowered. The convertible mechanism is not known at this point in time. However, it is believed that the two-piece retractable roof might either fold into and either over or under the engine cover of the new mid-engine 2020 Corvette Convertible.</p>

<h2>Design</h2><img width="400" height="200" src="images\img1.avif"/>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<img width="400" height="200" src="images\img3.avif"/>
<p>Stingray features a naturally aspirated V8 thatâ€™s positioned behind the driver, putting more power to the rear wheels where it matters most. And with a quarter-mile time of just 11.2 seconds* and an available 495 horsepower,* Stingray gives any driver the pulse-pounding ride they crave.</p>
